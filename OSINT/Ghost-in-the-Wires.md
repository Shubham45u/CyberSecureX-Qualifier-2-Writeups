# Ghost in the Wires

> They say once something is uploaded online, it never truly disappears. Can you find what was left behind by this OC?

Here i found the Keyword **OC and Ghost**

I Rushed to Dicord, I saw some roles, in the CybersecureX Discord Channel

In the Announcement Channel, I can see only 3 people can send messsages.
1. ethical-buddy
2. UnethicalBuddy
3. Robots_txt

They also have roles as oc in the discord.

As the description says, Ghost, uploaded online, cannot be deleted online. Probaly means **Github** as it has version control

1. UnethicalBuddy Posted, Write Ups for last CTF, got his Github from there. Nothing Exciting Over there.
2. Then ethical-buddy, Single google search is enough to find his github. Nothing here as well.
3. Noe we have to find github for Robots_txt.
