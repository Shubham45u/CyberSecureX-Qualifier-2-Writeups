# Ghost in the Wires

> They say once something is uploaded online, it never truly disappears. Can you find what was left behind by this OC?

Here i found the Keyword **OC and Ghost**

I Rushed to Dicord, saw admins, in the CybersecureX Discord Channel

There are 4 admin,
1. ethical-buddy
2. UnethicalBuddy
3. Robots_txt
4. root_kitten

They also have roles as oc in the discord.

As the description says, Ghost, uploaded online, cannot be deleted online. Probaly means **Github** as it has version control

1. UnethicalBuddy Posted, Write Ups for last CTF, got his Github from there. Nothing Exciting Over there.
2. Then ethical-buddy, Single google search is enough to find his github. Nothing here as well.
3. Couldn't find much about Robots_txt
4. I searched for the discord username and got a github profile.

Nothing found ;-;

It says **deleted**, we can try way back machine

Tried waybackmachine on all of the admin. Unfortunately Found nothing unusual for, ethical-buddy and unethicalbuddy. But there are some urls for root_kitten
